# simple_shedule

As a beginner, I am learning UI design while experimenting with color schemes, grid layouts, and other CSS features for my scheduling app. I recently created a scheme drawing to visualize the app's layout and flow.




# Introduction

As a beginner in programming, I am excited to announce that I am embarking on a new journey to improve my skills. My goal is to create a simple scheduling app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Project Overview

This project will challenge me to think creatively and solve problems, while also giving me a chance to practice my programming skills in a real-world context. By creating a simple data structure to store information about shifts and team members, I will be able to customize the app to fit my specific needs and experiment with different design layouts and features.

# My Approach

My approach to building this scheduling app will involve breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, such as building the UI, handling user input, and implementing the data structure. As I work on each task, I will document my progress and share updates with the programming community.

# Seeking Feedback

I am always open to feedback and suggestions from the programming community, and I believe that collaborating with others can greatly enhance my skills and understanding of programming. If you have any better ideas or approaches for this scheduling app project, please feel free to share them. Your input could help me improve my skills and create a better app.

# Inspiring Others

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, I hope that my journey will inspire you to take on a project that challenges you and helps you improve your skills. With hard work and dedication, we can achieve great things and become the programmers we aspire to be. So, I invite you to join me on this journey, and let's learn and grow together as a community.
